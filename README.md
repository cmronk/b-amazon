# Welcome to Bamazon!
I've created a MySQL Database with a Table labeled "products" that will house my items for sale on Bamazon.

Utilizing Node, we can view our items for sale and purchase various quantities and we are even informed when we do not have enough in stock to sell.

This first view shows our customer view.

This second view shows the manager view which allows for inventory management.

As shown above, managers can view all stock quantities as well as low quantities, update and order more stock, and order new products.

I utilized a MySQL database as well as the [mysql npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the[Inquirer npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and the [Cli-table npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table).
